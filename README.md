# Tool-Breakage-Dashboard-Excel
A professional Excel dashboard built on sample data, showcasing tool breakage trends by machine, tool type, reason, and product for analytics practice.

📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Excel dashboard designed to analyze tool breakage data in a manufacturing setup. The dataset used here is sample and completely imaginary, created for demonstration and learning purposes only.

The dashboard enables users to quickly identify patterns, breakdowns, and root causes by visualizing data across machines, tools, tool types, products, and reasons for downtime. With interactive slicers, users can filter data dynamically and gain actionable insights for reducing tool failure and improving operational efficiency.

📂 Dataset Description

The sample dataset consists of ~2000 records with the following fields:

Machine – Identifier of the machine where breakage occurred

Tool Number & Name – Specific tool details

Downtime (mins/hrs) – Duration of downtime caused by tool failure

Tool Type – Category/type of the tool

Reason – Cause of breakage 

Product – Product linked with the tool/machine usage

⚠️ Note: All data is fictional and for practice/analysis purposes only.

📊 Dashboard Features

Machine-wise Count of Broken Tools

Displays the frequency of tool breakages per machine.

Tool Name & Count

Highlights the most frequently failing tools.

Tool Type-wise Reasons

Maps reasons for failure against tool categories.

Reason-wise Count of Tools

Shows the distribution of tool breakages by reason.

Product-wise Count of Tools

Connects tool failures to specific products.

Interactive Slicers

Filters available for Reason, Tool Type, Tool Number, and Machine.

🚀 How to Use

Open the Excel file containing the dashboard.

Use slicers to filter by reason, machine, tool type, or tool number.

Hover over charts to view detailed breakdowns.

Analyze machine-level and product-level trends.

🔎 Key Insights & Applications

Identify machines with frequent tool failures.

Detect tools most prone to breakage.

Understand root causes of downtime.

Link failures to specific products for production planning.

Demonstrates how Excel dashboards can simplify manufacturing analytics.

📈 Recommendations

Use similar dashboards on real datasets for preventive maintenance.

Replace tools showing high breakage frequency.

Conduct operator training if human factors dominate reasons.

Extend this analysis using Power BI / Python for predictive insights.
